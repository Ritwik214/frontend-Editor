How the CodePen Clone Project Works
1. Landing Page
When users visit the landing page of your CodePen clone, they are presented with a user interface resembling the CodePen website. The interface consists of various sections that allow users to write, edit, and preview HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code snippets.

2. Code Editor
Multi-Language Support: Users can switch between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tabs to access separate code editor panels for each language.

Syntax Highlighting: The code editors are equipped with syntax highlighting, making it easier for users to read and write code by visually distinguishing different elements.

Auto-Completion: While typing, users receive code suggestions and auto-completion options to streamline the coding process.

3. Preview Pane
Live Preview: As users type code in the editor panels, the preview pane updates in real-time, showing how the code changes immediately affect the rendered output.

Interactive Output: Users can interact with the output in the preview pane, such as clicking buttons or links, to see how their code behaves in an interactive environment.

4. Responsive Design
The CodePen clone project is designed with responsiveness in mind:

Adaptable Layout: The interface layout is responsive, ensuring that it looks and functions well across different devices and screen sizes, similar to CodePen's behavior.
